.SYNOPSIS  
   Creates two registry keys that disable the "light theme" changing it to the dark theme!
   (which is way cool in my opinion)
   Automating the world one line of code at a time.
 
.DESCRIPTION
   There is not too much to it, this simply creates two new registry keys, one in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE directory `
   and one in HKEY_CURRENT_USER directory. Both of the registry keys are called "AppsUseLightTheme" and get assigned `
   a dword value of 0 which in turn after logging out and back in the light theme will be turned off leaving you with `
   the cool hidden black theme!

.EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> Set-DarkTheme
   After Running the script you simply have to type Set-DarkTheme and hit enter and the changes will be made, `
   this shouldn't take more than a srecound to complete. there is a prompt at the end however asking you to hit `
   enter to log out, this is for the registry changes to take effect

.NOTES
   Just though I'd turn this into a script quick so others can use it and share it. Spread the word y'all!

    Version             : 5.0 - Strickly designed for the full general public release of Windows 10 on 7/29/2015.
